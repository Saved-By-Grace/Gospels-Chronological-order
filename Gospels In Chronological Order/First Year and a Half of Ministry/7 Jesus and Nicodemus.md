### John 3:1-21
Nicodemus came at night to see Jesus, he was a Pharisee, he came at night because of shame 
Nicodemus said the science Jesus performed a truly from God, he believed, he had an open mind, and was an intellectual in the word of God
Jesus told him "no one can see the kingdom, unless he is born again" but nicodemus didn't understand

"no one can enter the kingdom of God, unless they're born of ==water== and ==spirit Spirit=="
**Spirit-** self explanatory, when you accept christ in your life it changes you
**Water** 
		- NOT baptism, this would contradict saved by faith 
		- he didn't say the word baptism
		- 2 theories
			** Physical birth** 
				- Baby in fluid sac filled in womb is born in water just like spiritual birth we don't do anything to make it happen V6 "flesh gives birth to flesh"
				- My argument against (seems too much human thinking, but not impossible)
					- What about aborted babies?
					- Then that would mean since they arent born you can make the argument they are not living (so there is no harm in aborting them), or they are living and they go to hell
			- Spiritual cleansing therefore born of water and born in spirit are the same meaning, its a call to be to be cleansed 
				-Old T 
					- Ezekiel 3625 "I'll sprinkle clean water on you, and you'll be clean… From all impurities "
					- Number is 19:17–19 water was used to clean people who are unclean
					- psalms 51:2, 7 using water to clean people
			- (woman at well)
v8 wind blows but you dont know where it starts/ends just like holy spirit, we don't need to know everything about the new birth to receive it. 
Like wind we cant control it but can feel its presence 

v10 Nico an intellectual of the word should have known what Jesus meant and hes a Pharisee so he had a different thought processes 

v14 Moses and snake prophesy of Christ
v16 Love verses v17 he here to save not to judge (that comes later)
v20 light exposes and its hard getting all the nasty exposed, easier in darkness but better in light
