## John's Ministry 
#### John 1:19-28

John claims "he is the voice of one calling in the wilderness..." Isaiah 40:3

Isaiah 40 is titles "Israel's release from captivity"

fitting for Jesus time because they were in bondage from the Romans and were waiting for a messiah

John's job was to prepare for the messiah by calling people to repent for the messiah is near

He was calling for baptism of water calling people to repent 

John was the first prophet in over 700 years and stepped back to let Jesus tak ethe spotlight
## John Acknowledges Jesus

When John sees him he says "Look the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the earth" John compared him to sacrificial lamb to die and through his blood paid the price. 

Did John know (prophetic)? Or simile 

It seems as though there's contradictions with the synoptic gospels and John. And synoptic gospels, Jesus gets baptized and go straight to the wilderness, John says that after the baptism, the next day, Jesus calls in disciples (No mention of the temptation). The answer is that John (Author) was only recounting the testimony of John (Baptist)
