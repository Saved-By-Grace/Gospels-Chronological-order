Matthew 3:13 "to Fullfill all righteousness" (needed to relate to sinful men by taking place with sinners and being baptized)

**Matthew** "==This== is my son whom I love with ==Him== I am well pleased"

**Mark** "==You== are my son whim I love with ==you== I am well pleased "

**Luke** "==You== are my son whim I love with ==you== I am well pleased "
