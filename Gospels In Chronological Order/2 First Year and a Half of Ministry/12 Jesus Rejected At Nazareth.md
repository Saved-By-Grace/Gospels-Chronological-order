v16 he went to synangogue "as was his custom" Jesus even as God was still going to church

v17 He read Isaiah 61:1-2 "Spirit of the Lord on me... proclaim goodness to pwer....release prisoners.. year of favor of the lord"
Context, Isaiah wrote this when they were in exile in Babylon, and brought about "year of jubilee" which debt was forgiven every 50 years, however, they were not Fried, and we're still under Babylon. Therefore, the prophecy of Jesus was being delivered.

Jesus stopped right before ".. and day of vengence of God" which is possibly second coming

v20 Jesus says after reading scroll scripture being fullfilled by him

v22 'surely quote be proverb' basically Jesus knows people want proof from his miracles that they heard of

Jesus was raised in Nazareth, the people felt that Jesus was theirs, and could command his powers (Spurgen). They knew Jesus as a kid, and maybe that impacted their view.

v24-27
"No prophet accepted in his hometown"
Elijah went to one widow, amongst many others in Israel during the famine
Elisha only went to Naaman on monks to many others in Israel who had leperosy
Naman was syrian 

Jesus was comparing them to the northern tribes in Israel and Elijah's time

Proof that god sometimes chooses gentiles over Jews for his glory

Gentiles were considered "undeserving" of Grace

2 Kings 5 Naman, interesting, and the story where Naman was healed he didn't have to give anything, however, Elijah servant went on ahead and ask for money to get rich, He told Naman he needed to pay two talents. Elijah caught him and cursed him leprosy.

Pearl with gentiles getting saved, while juice getting cursed for his crimes

v28 the people in the synagogue hated this and tried to throw him off the hill
