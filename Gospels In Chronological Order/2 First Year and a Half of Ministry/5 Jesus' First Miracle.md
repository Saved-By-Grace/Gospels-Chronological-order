### John 2:1-12
#Miracle


Jesus disciples were invited (known posse)

Jesus was there teacher and was common that students would learn under them by living and hanging out with them

Jesus calling Mary woman was not disrespectful in that culture. It was more of a separation that he is no longer the role of her son but of the anointed one.

My time has not come yet, Mary probably wanted Jesus to be public with his miracle, but he did this miracle in secret

Jesus was ordained for his ministry with his baptism so why didn't he start right away with public figure?

Parallel with David, who is anointed as king by Samuel, even though saul was still in power
Running out of one of the social disgrace wine=Joy

The water jars were used for cleansing look at [[27 Six Woes]] for more info 
verse 7 it was filled to the brim and plain but nothing else could've been added, and that it was just water

The family is gonna live in shame, but the wind save them from shame, just like the blood of Jesus does for us

Disciples believe in him, this was the first proof of his power
