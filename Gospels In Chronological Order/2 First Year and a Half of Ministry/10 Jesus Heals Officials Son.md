Men came from Capernaum (20 miles, according to study Bible), and begged Jesus to heal his sick son

He backed, he was a high ranking official, and had higher legal authority, yet he humbled himself, asking Jesus for help

v48 
"Unless you see a sign you people will never believe" for us it seems as though Jesus was brushing him off, but it was Jesus seeing his faith first then see the sign

v50
Jesus healed his son, but the man could not see it. He needed to believe.

v51-52 
Sermon met him, stating that his son was healed, and the timing lineup when Jesus had healed him

v53
"He and his whole household believed" had to live by faith and have the action to back it up. The service believed, and then left at once.

Mark 11:24 "pray as thought you have already received it"
