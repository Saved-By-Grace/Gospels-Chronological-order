### John 4:1-42
![[Pasted image 20250204180351.png]]
v4 "Had to go..."  implies divine guidance 
Though samaria was a straight shot and shortest distance jews would intentionally take the longer route to avoid the half breeds

That is how much hate was in there hearts

Because of this animosity Samaritans had there own place of worship on Mount Gerizim the equivalent of Jerusalem

Samaritans only had the Pentateuch which was another issue to jews

v5 land of Sychar very Important historical site (Abraham first came to Canna from Babylon, Abraham build alter upon name of the Lord)

v6 Jesus tired and wanted to rest it was noon 

v7-9 

Samaritan woman was asked by Jesus for water. It is suspicious that she is there at noon because it's too hot to go, the better time is early in the morning or the cool afternoon 

This might show that she was a promiscuous woman known to everyone, and that not many people wanted to accompany her, or that she separated herself out of shame

Jesus ask for water, are you talking to Samaritan woman was wrong let alone asking for some water was even worse


(Enduring Word) Rabbis, not seen publicly, talking to women not even their own wife

v10 choose a response back 
- "if only you knew the gift of God"
- "who it was asking for a drink"
- "he would've given living water" 

is this time back with Old Testament where Jesus was a calling himself to be messiah

v13 jesus" whatever drinks for the water, I give them will never thirst. "We all have things that we seek after spiritually. Jesus, claiming that he alone can quench ad and will never look for anything else again.

"Akamai Spring within them, welding up to eternal life". It's more than quench it creates eternal life.

The living water he's talking about specifically is Holy Spirit. Call mom when we believe it fills us and gives us new life, quenching the spirit. 

v15 She still misunderstands and asks it to quench her phyiscal thirst

v16-19
Jesus tells her to bring her husband
- She had 5 husbands, having that that many shows that she's long after something
- we don't know her background, why she became the way (give grace) 
- sex for safety? Woman were not equals 
- Jesus brings up her husbands to make her understand. She was taking the thirst as a literal thirst, Jesus, then points out her need to go from man-to-man, as her thirst.
- Jesus is going to quencher from that neat by giving her the water to save her

possibly from shame in v19 she chages the topic and brings up the mountain (Gerizim) and asks where is the proper place to worship

v22 Samaritans were mixed race and only excepted the Pentateuch, they like all people that time would mix religions together. This is why Jesus said "you do not know what you worship."

v23 "Worship in spirit and in truth"
- **Sprirt** No longer on mountain or Jerusalem (anywhere)
- **Truth** 
	- She wasn't living/worshipping in truth 
	- Jesus/God want true worship, comes from the heart

v26 Jesus states he is the messiah she was told about
