*recap:*
- * dude wasn't here but leaves because he was creating opposition, then goes to Galley area and passes through scenario then settles in Capernaum, which is in Gallilee*

v12-16 Jesus settles in Capernaum between the lake in the area of Zebulum, and Naphtali b/c Isaiah 9:1-2 where it talks about this area being in darkness but one will come to take them out of darkness

Isaiah 9 the whole chapter talks about Jesus (9:6 to us a child is born.. prince of peace)

EW mentions that Galilee had a mix of groups jew + gentile showing that Jesus came for them too

### Matthew 4:17
### Mark 1:14-15


Matthew - Repent for the kingdom of **Heaven** has come near
Mark- Repent for the kingdom of **God** has come near

Matthew was writing for jews so out of respect he didn't include God's name
