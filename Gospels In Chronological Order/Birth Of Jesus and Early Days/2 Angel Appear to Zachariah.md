## Luke 1:1-25


Zachariah and Elizabeth were seen as righteous by God, similar to Noah
They were old and unable to conceive similar to Abraham and Sarah
He didn't believe the angel like Sarah, and became mute whereas Sarah was laughing
John is going to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and he was not allowed to drink anything fermented (Nazarene Vow)
Elizabeth said in Luke 1:25 "taken away, my disgrace ", reminds me of Hannah
She was probably mocked for her lack of child
