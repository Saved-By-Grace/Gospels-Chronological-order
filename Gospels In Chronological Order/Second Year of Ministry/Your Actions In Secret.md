# Giving to the needy
### Matthew 6:1-4

V1 do not show the the facade of righteousness with the intent to hav people worship you
V2 Do not make a showing of your good deeds
what are the reasons for your good deed?
- Get praise from man and God?
- Honor God?
- Help others?
The intention behind everything matters
Would you still give if no one would ever see
V2 "Their have received their reward in full"
	The reward f human praise is all they get because that is what they wanted
	
v3 " “Keep the thing so secret that even you yourself are hardly aware that you are doing anything at all praiseworthy. Let God be present, and you will have enough of an audience.” (Spurgeon)" 
This could only happen if its is a reflex, that its so natural that you don't even think about it and could even possible forget.

V4 The lord will reward what is done in secret

# Praying in Secret 
### Matthew 5:1-14

When you pray also pray in secret rather than to get attention of man (just like with giving)
Pray in private in your room not in public

v7 Pray in private and speak with God rather than speaking eloquent words for the attention of man

In public we might be more self conscious about what we say and do which can impede us getting intimate with God

When we do it in public for praise we are using God as a tool (Enduring Word)

v8 your father knows what you need before you ask

Your request are not the first the Lord has heard of 

*“Prayer is not designed to inform God, but to give man a sight of his misery; to humble his heart, to excite his desire, to inflame his faith, to animate his hope, to raise his soul from earth to heaven, and to put him in mind that THERE is his Father, his country, and inheritance.” (clarke)*

kinda like a cathartic experience, and making you aware of your weakness, and make you rely on God

# How to pray

v9 "Our father... " this was new, calling God a father was too intimate of a relationship, this was new for them
Saying in heaven was showing Gods holiness 

V10 
Saying let your will be done and not ours
Trusting/Understanding that his will is best for us more than anything

v11 
Many thoughts
the bread could be the
	The Word 
	Jesus 
	Actual food 
	Foreshadowing last supper 
Actual food also works because God cares for our daily needs not just our small ones

12 Forgive our debt(sin) 
as we forgive others, Jesus mentions this in v14 and John 20:23 where he mentions how if you do not forgive the Lord will not forgive you 

13 lead us not into temptation
temptation means tested, and pray to be delivered 
We will not be test more than we bear (1 Cor 10:13)

14 Jesus saying a forgiving heart is a must 
Lack of forgiveness breeds hate and/or anger which is not of God
