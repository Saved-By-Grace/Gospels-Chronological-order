### Matthew 7:7-12 and Luke 11:5-13

**Ask**- how a child will boldly keep asking for something even when they are told no, have that same boldness to ask God in prayer

**seek**- when you seek its a follow through with the request, and Jesus promises that those who seek will find what they are looking for

**knock** - even when the door seems closed, knock, the lord will always open. Always willing to help regardless in the time of day (*Luke 11:8*)

**M9-11** analogy of stone when asked for a bread or snake when asked for fish. Everyone knows that its wrong, even the godless, yet how much more will God take care of us.

**M12** Golden rule, treat others how you want to be treated. 

**L5-8** persistency is key, the man asked, seeked, knocked very late at night, yet his persistence and boldness is what enables him to get what he wants, God wants us to come to him the same way
