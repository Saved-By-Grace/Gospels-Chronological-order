### Matthew 7:13-14 and  Luke 18-21 (Seperate/repeated teaching in Perea)

Narrow gate- it is small its is difficult, the way to eternal life, [EW](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/matthew-7/) *The true gate is both narrow and difficult. If your road has a gate that is easy and well-traveled, you do well to watch out.*

Broad gate its easy and wide but leads to destruction

Jesus shows that following him is not easy it will be the harder path to follow
