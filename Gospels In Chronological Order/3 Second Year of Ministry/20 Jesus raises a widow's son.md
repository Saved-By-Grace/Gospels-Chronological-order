#widow
v12 She was a widow, with her only son. Although there were laws to help take care of widows, they had hard lives. They couldn't own property and they were usually taken care of by their kids. Since her son was dead she was going to be alone with no one to help

v13 Jesus had compassion on her
He saw her suffering and had compassion on her. He went to her and said "Dont cry"

V14 as we saw from [[19 Healing of Centurion's Slave]] a word from Jesus was all that was needed to heal the boy. 

Jesus healing the son saved the widow from a difficult and lonely life. To that widow Jesus gave her life as well

v16 The people who saw this believed a great prophet was among them, and that "God has come to help his people"

v17 Word spread about Jesus, He was gettig clout
