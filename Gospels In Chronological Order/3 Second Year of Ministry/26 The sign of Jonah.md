#### Mt 12:38-42 L 29-32

As always we see the people want to see more signs, cause everything that Jesus had been doing was not enough for them

Jesus responds M39 L29
calling them evil cause their intentions were not to glorify God but to either find fault with his miracle or watch

Jesus said that the sign the would receive was like Jonah in the belly for 3 days and nights, so Jesus was going to be in the earth which was foreshadowing his death and resurrection

He also mentions v42 of Queen of the South (Gentiles) came to hear the wisdom of the Solomon (Jesus) and were enamored

Jesus claims that he is greater than these two




#### Mt 43-45 L 24-29

Jesus points out that clearing yourself of sin is good but if Chirst is not filling that up Satan will come and fill it with sin and bring more 'friends' sin leaving you worse off
