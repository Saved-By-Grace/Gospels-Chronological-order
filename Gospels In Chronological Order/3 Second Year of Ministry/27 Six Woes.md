#### v37-31

v37-38 Jesus was invited by a pharisee to eat at his house and questioned why he did not wash before the meal 

v39 Jesus insults him (he was right tho)

**Washing**
[EW](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/luke-11/)
- i. “This the Pharisees deemed as great a sin as to commit fornication.” (Trapp)

- ii. For these ceremonial washings, Barclay described how special stone vessels of water were kept because ordinary water might be ceremonially unclean [[5 Jesus' First Miracle]]. In performing the ceremonial washing, one started with at least enough of this water to fill one and one-half eggshells. One began by pouring the water over the hands starting at the fingers and running down towards the wrist. Then each palm was cleansed by rubbing the fist of the other hand into it. Water was poured over the hands again, this time from the wrist towards the fingers.

- iii. A _really_ strict Jew would do this not only before the meal, but also between each course through the meal. The rabbis were deadly serious about this, saying that bread eaten with unwashed hands was no better than excrement. A rabbi who once failed to do this was considered excommunicated. Another rabbi was imprisoned by the Romans and used his ration of water for ceremonial cleansing instead of drinking, nearly dying of thirst – but being regarded as a great hero.

- iv. If these religious leaders were as concerned about cleansing their hearts as they were about their hands, they would be more godly men. We often want to look to a ceremony or a ritual to cleanse us, instead of the sacrificial work of God on our behalf.

Washing was a tradition they NEEDED to do to cleanse them selves *physically* however Jesus mocks them for being so focused on the outside appearance being good while the insides were vile. 

He calls them greedy and wicked and His solution was for them to give to the poor

### Woes

Jesus gives 6 woes, 3 for pharisees and 3 for experts in the law

#### Pharisees 
- v42 *"Woe because you give God a tenth.... but neglect justice and love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone."*
	- The Pharisees were so legalistic that they would even tithe a 1/10 of from there herb garden
	- How ever they over looked justice and their motives for giving were not out of love for God
	- Jesus in the last part was saying there giving is good, however they should not have neglected love and justice. 
- v43 *"Woe because you love all the important seats in the synagogues..."*
	- They saw these positions as possible ways to get noticed by people of their "faith" and zealous 
- v44 *"Woe to you because you are like unmarked graves which people walk over without knowing*
	- OT laws stated that you were unclean if you touched a dead body or a grave
	- Jesus compares them to the grave where they made everyone else they interact with unclean
	- He also mentions "without knowing it", showing their blindness for their own corruption

#### Experts in the law
- v46 *"Woe because you load ppl with burdens... you will not help them"*
	- They were quick to point out and create more laws (not ordained by God) and penances that people needed to do, binding them more in the law, without showing them the truth and the help
	- We see how they made healing unlawful on the sabbath, and just overall how they made man for the sabbath rather than the other way around
- v47 *"Woe because you build tombs for prophets" you killed*
	- They had killed many prophets and messengers that the lord provided, ultimately rejecting them as they do to Jesus the final and perfect prophet
- v52 *"Woe because you take the key of knowledge. You yourselves have not entered , and hinder those who were entering"*
	- They were the ones that knew the law and were entrusted with bringing people to God, but their God became the laws. If anything they made an idol out of them for the loved the laws more than God
	- They also misunderstood the laws and taught misinterpreted versions
	- They hindered people who loved God and were turned towards the laws instead


Naturally Jesus had ops from this and they wanted to kill him
