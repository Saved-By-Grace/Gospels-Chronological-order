Mt22 - L20 
Jesus Heals a blind deaf man

Mt24 - Mk22 - L15
Pharisees became instant haters and claimed he got his powers from Satan

Mt25 - Mk23 - L17
Jesus respinds back saying how can a kingdom devided against itself stand?

Mt27 - L19
Jesus asks them if he is casting them out by the power of satan then how are they casting out demons, probably a quip to humble them
They were prolly ineffective in casting out demons and their anger and jealousy resulted in them to do something

Mt29 - Mk27 - L21

**Mathew Mark** "no one can enter strong man's house without first having them up. Then he completed the strong man's house."

**Luke** "what a strong man, fully armed guards, his own house, his possessions are safe. But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder."

 Gospels do not say the same parable but the meaning is still the same. It is a Jesus is that stronger man (Luke) and it's able to defeat that strong man (the devil). And in Matthew Mark Jesus is saying he will tie up the devil to defeat him. And Luke Jesus is saying that he is much stronger than the devil, and will completely destroy him.

The spoils are the souls that Jesus saves


Mt 30 L 23
There is no compromise with God and should not be indifferent or neither. You need to have your heart fully with him to be with hum
