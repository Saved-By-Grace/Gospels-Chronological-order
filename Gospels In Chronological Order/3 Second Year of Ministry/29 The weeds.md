### Mt 13:24-30

The farmer is Jesus, The 
Good seeds and bad seeds were not noticeable until they sprouted, 
why wait till harvest?

Seems like a grey area of being unable to identify people as good or bad until judgment, wait and let the lord judge them not us


v 30 seperation of wheat and weeds, judgement day where all the good crops are collected and weeds are destroyed, God justice is fair and just


### Mt 13:36-43
The farmer is Jesus
Harvesters are angels
The seeds are the poeple
satan is the enemy
The fire is like the end of age where there willbe #WeepingAndGnashingofTeeth
