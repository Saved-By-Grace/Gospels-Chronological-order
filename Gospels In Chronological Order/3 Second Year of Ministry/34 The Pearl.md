### Mt 13: 45-46

Kingdom of heaven like a merchant looking for pearls that when he finds one of great value sells everything

Similar to [[34 Parable of the Hidden Treasure]] wear Jesus looks for us and sees us a fine pearls

Though it seems more foolish here to sell all you have for a pearl compared to treasures, but thats how much Jesus loves us that to us it is reckless but to him it is something he truly desires

It is only fine pearls that he is going after not ugly or nasty pearls
