one plants one waters but god gives the increase

The man is us we are tasked to sow seeds to all, that is all he does in V27 through no effort of the man the seed perplexingly still grows

We may only give a short word or not say things as elegantly and clearly as we would like but the seed is still plants, God will change the person and grow greatly from the person

Don't be timid in sharing if you feel like you will mess us the HS will guide you and you only need to plant a seed whether small or big

1 Corth 3:6-8 one plants another seeds God gives the increase

Similar to [[32 Mustard Seed]] from small to great change
