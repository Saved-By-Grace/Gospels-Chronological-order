## Differences in Accounts
#### [[#Matthews Account]]  
- account shows the centurion going to Jesus needing haling
#### [[#Lukes Account]]
- account shows the centurion sent Jew elders then a friend on his behalf never coming before God


### Matthews Account
M6 the centurion refers to him as Lord. He was a man in power and authority yet he humbly came ignoring his earthly position. We should be doing that as we come to the Lord. Whatever great you are on earth leave behind all pity. 

Because of Roman occupation there was hostility between Jew and Roman. This caused Jews to hate them, yet a Roman humbly came to Jesus for help. 

[EW](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/matthew-8/) says that in all instances (7) that centurions are mentioned they are presented in a positive light. 

Slaves were not equal footing as normal people EW *"This centurion had an unusual attitude towards his slave. Under Roman law a master had the right to kill his slave, and it was expected that he would do so if the slave became ill or injured to the point where he could no longer work."*

The centurion simply tells Jesus his problem not asking to heal his servant, or how to heal him. 

Application when you are coming before God do you ever have your own solution to a problem?
Do you ever just trust to bring your problem and have him to solve your problems? 

M7 Jesus ask "shall I come heal him"?
[EW](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/matthew-8/) "*It was completely against Jewish custom for a Jew to enter a Gentiles’ house; yet it was not against God’s law.*"

M8 The centurion said not to come for he did not want to inconvenience Jesus. But as we saw with [[7 Jesus and Nicodemus]] there is never a time that is inconvenient, and here we see that there is no place inconvenient to meet or go with you.   

M9 The centurion had said that, a word from Jesus was sufficient enough to heal his servant. The centurion continues to explain he knows the power of a word from someone in authority and gives his experience as a centurion. In doing so the centurion shows some understanding of Jesus' authority and power. 

M10 Jesus was amazed at the gentile and fires shots at Jews
The gentiles will replace the Jews in the feast of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. The jews felt as if it rightful for them to be with their "founding fathers" but Jesus says that this wasn't the case and they can even be excluded from the kingdom from their pride.

EW "*This was a radical idea to many of the Jewish people in Jesus’ day; they assumed that this great Messianic Banquet would have no Gentiles, and that all Jews would be there. Jesus corrected both mistaken ideas.*"

### Lukes Account
L2 as we mentioned earlier him having any care for the servant was an uncommon event 
L3 The centurion had sent Jew elders to Jesus cause, Jesus was getting notoriety 
Weird that he himself didnt go but we see in L7 why
The Jew elders spoke very highly of him and said that the Centurion was deserving of Jesus healing because he was a Good man. Again we see the centurion in a positive light even though culturally they were hated. 
Jesus went towards his house 

L6 We see that He sent his friends to meet Jesus before coming to the home because he had felt he was unworthy to have Jesus and did not deem himself worthy to meet him.

EW mentions the character of the man "*The centurion was a remarkable man. The elders said he was worthy; he said he was not worthy. They praised him for building a house of worship; he felt unworthy that Jesus would come to his house. They said he was deserving; he felt himself undeserving. Strong faith and great humility are entirely compatible.*" 
His humility and faith was ultimately what saved his servant. 

L8 The centurion had said that, a word from Jesus was sufficient enough to heal his servant. The centurion continues to explain he knows the power of a word from someone in authority and gives his experience as a centurion. In doing so the centurion shows some understanding of Jesus' authority and power. 

L9 We see Jesus amazed at his words and shots fired at Israel "I have not found such great faith even in Israel"


### Reconciling The Differences
[source](https://answersingenesis.org/contradictions-in-the-bible/centurion-contradiction/) im summarizing
1. Matthew gave a abridged account and followed the idea that *"that what one does by another one does by oneself"* , basically the centurion sending the elders and his friends were a mere proxy for him and represented his intentions.
