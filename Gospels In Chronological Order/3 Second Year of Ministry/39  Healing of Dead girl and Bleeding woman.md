### Mt 9:18-23 Mk 5:21-42 Lk 8:40-53


Jesus was approached by a synagogue leader (Jiarus)  and humbled himself for Jesus to heal his daughter 

The man said Jesus will heal her not asking if he but will he

this was prolly a bold thing to do with someone with his rank, clearly he was desperate and cared more for his daughter than he did his position

mk and luke make it point that the servants came to give the news that the girl is dead and not to bother Jesus, the father mustve been hurt. He finally had Jesus but he migthve thought he was too late, but Jesus says "Dont be afraid just believe and she will be healed"

They go in the house and see the mourners and music but jesus interrupts them and tells them that shes just sleeping not head. They didnt believe

Jesus only had the mother, father, and peter, james, john and healed the daughter and tells them not to tell anyone what he did.

why did he have such a small initmate rather than big and public spectacle so that people would believe

Maybe Jesus wanted that intimate moment with the family and not with others who were their for spectacle. 




With the bleeding woman she was bleeding for a long time. She was probably in agony and shame. 

She touched his cloak and was healed, she was scared to go to him and felt unworthy and maybe beleive that little power can heal her completely. period, u were unlcean so her touching Jesus or anyone was illegal 

MK and LK show that Jesus stops after she touches him and claims the power left him?

Jesus in his omniscient knwos yet for forces her to out herself publically, why?

She confesses and Jesus said her faith healed her and be free from suffering

Small bit of Jesus brought a big change in her life, how much more can he do in out lives if we let him?


Both healing Jesus did the woman publically and the father privately
The woman was instant healing the mans healing was later 
Man was of important status and the woman was low class

Both thought the touch from Jesus would do it
Both healed
