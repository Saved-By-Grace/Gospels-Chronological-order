### Matthew 19- 24

19/20 storing things on earth will last a life time, however the things stored in heaven will last an eternity. 

but what is this treasure?
- souls you save
- treasures are things we hold dear so presence of God, worshipping him

22 the eye is the lamp of the body 
the things we injest affects our inside, the content you watch/ things you see affect the thought of your mind. It is also spiritual vision, when our eyes are healthy we are full of light but the instance we let our own evil desires could our vision we no longer become healthy and inside is full of darkness, think of preachers that use the word for gain

No one can serve two masters, especially when they are at odds with each other
When we seek for only money thats greed and becomes our master, our intentions for it matter
EW Serve the Lord with your money and the money will serve you. 


In this chapter Jesus highlights the motives of why we do things, and making sure we are not doing it with the intention of fanning human praise. Giving to the needy is noble and commanded by God, but when you use the very tool that is to honor God to get human fame, you no longer recieve Gods praise. Same for fasting, the very act is meant to deny your flesh to rely on God, the irony that it was used to show piety
