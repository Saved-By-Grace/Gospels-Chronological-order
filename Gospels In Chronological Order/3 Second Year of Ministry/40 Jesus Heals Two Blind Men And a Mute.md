### Mt 9:27-34

After healing sick daughter and left two blind ppl started following him "Have mercy on us son of david"

Son of david pointing to his royal/messiah descendant, how did they know? Was Jesus making it known his history or was it the culture to knw who u are the son of?

Jesus definitely heard them but yet he keeps on walking and goes indoors, 
The blind followed him? How? guides? Did they have friends/family who also believed?

Jesus questions them even after being blind and coming to jesus after they called out to him. He asked them if they believed and they said yes Lord. He healed them and it was because of their faith  that their eyesight was restored

He commanded them not to tell anyone what had happened, but they still preached
Imagine potentially being blind your whole, or just loosing your eyesight and relying on other people to do things for you and you one day walk up to people being restored? they are gonna be mad confused and want to know what happened. 

Jesus knows this, why even bother telling them not to tell anyone? 

Then after healing Jesus getting beack to back action of healing, a demon possesseed man that makes him go mute was driven out and began to speak. 

"Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel"

The haters came ( #pharisee ) and said that he a demon was driving out demons 

but no no no we know that a house divided against itself cant fall (that verse wasnt here)
