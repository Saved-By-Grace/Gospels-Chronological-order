#### Mt 31-32 Mk 28-29

The sins speaking against the holy spirit will be forgiven but blaspheming against the holy spirit will never be forgiven. 

Why? (idk I had to look it up)

[gotquestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/blasphemy-Holy-Spirit.html)

	"Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has to do with accusing Jesus Christ of being demon-possessed instead of Spirit-filled. This particular type of blasphemy cannot be duplicated today in the same manner as in Jesus’ day. The Pharisees were in a unique moment in history: they had the Law and the Prophets, they had the Holy Spirit stirring their hearts, they had the Son of God Himself standing right in front of them, and they saw with their own eyes the miracles He did. Never before in the history of the world (and never since) had so much divine light been granted to men; if anyone should have recognized Jesus for who He was, it was the Pharisees. Yet they chose defiance. They purposely attributed the work of the Spirit to the devil, even though they knew the truth and had the proof. Jesus declared their willful blindness to be unpardonable. Their blasphemy against the Holy Spirit was their final rejection of God’s grace. They had set their course, and God was going to let them sail into perdition unhindered."


Blasphemy against the holy spirit was the final door the pharisees shut before to accepting Christ. 

Interestingly enough they draw a connection from here, they say that after this Jesus started speaking in parables, which event he disciples questioned Mt 13:3 "Why do you speakin in parables...." 

Note that Jesus did not preach in parables because of their rejection, he did it after this event

He spoke in parables because he was fulfilling old testament prophesy. Eze 12:2




#### Mt 33-36

v33 You are recognized by what you produce there is no mistaking it [[17 A Tree And Its Fruit]]
and we see that they are full of evil because they were in complete objection to Christ, "from the heart the mouth speaks"

A bucket can only spill what it is full of, same as us

v36-37 
We are held accountable for every empty word they have spoken either this helps us or harms us
