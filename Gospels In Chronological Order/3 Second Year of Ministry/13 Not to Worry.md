### Matthew 6:25-34  and Luke 12:22-31 (repeated/sperate teaching in Perea)

The normal basic needs we cant live without
- food and drink
- clothing
These are normal and valid concerns to have, think about Jesus is challenge that mindset of worrying over everything and rely on God to provide, "the lord knows what you need before you ask " Matt 6:8

26 comparison of birds who dont do anything yet they still exist and just rely on God
Think of man who stores their grains, and hordes everything yet they will still be seeking more

27 What good is worrying, worrying about all your needs you cant add time to you life, think of the stress it kills and takes life from you

28-30 We can marvel at the works of His hands the intricacies of nature, yet if he puts this much into the small details of nature how much more will he do that for us 

He wants to give us freedom with this reliance of him, not falling to our own strength but leaning on the everlasting arm

32 Pagans run after these things and God knows that you need them. 

33 Seek first kindom.....
	- EW "For example, we rarely have to choose between honoring God and loving our wives or being good workers. We honor God and **seek first the kingdom of God** by being good husbands and good workers." 
	- meaning that seeking his kingdom is being a imitator of Christ?
	- Honor God in everything we do
	- In Jesus's Other parables he says "kingdom of heaven is like" and it about people who live honorable (glorofy God) and what happens to those who don't
	- We need to be made right before him 

Jesus brings v33 up because he shows seeking after earthly desires (looking at all of 6) will not bring you nothing but worry, temporary gain and praise. 

v34 Stop worrying about things you can control yet and focus on now
Logically when you to worried about tomorrow you forget to enjoy whats here 
in this perpetual "whats next" will not give you peace, ironically the reasoning behind worrying about the future is to be safe. However in doing this we can forget to enjoy the present the things God has given us today. 

"wish you could know you were in the good times"
you can't and it would be wise to enjoy what you have when you have it.
