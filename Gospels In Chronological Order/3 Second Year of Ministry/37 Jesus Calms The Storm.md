### Mt 8:23-27 Mk 4:35-41 Lk 8:22-25
#Gallilee #Miracle 

They were in a boat and a storm came that was too the point of making expert fishermen afraid of the turbulent water. 

Interesting, fishermen would have seen the weather coming (looking online they wouldve seen the clouds, windspeed, and other natrual phenomena to predict the weather)

Was it divine, a lesson that God wanted to show case his power?

They were terrified, but meanwhile Jesus was sleeping even in the storm. I imagine have to be fully comfortable, and feel safe to sleep soundly in that much noise and movement. Jesus knew he was gonna be fine.

They awoke him understandably afraid but Jesus says "You of little faith, why are you afraid". Was Jesus mocking them, rebuking, or reassuring them?


mt shows Jesus rebuking the disciples first then calming the storm
mk, lk show Jesus rebuke storm and then disciples 

I point this out cause spurgeon had said "He spoke to the men first, for they were the most difficult to deal with: wind and sea could be rebuked afterwards."

After all this they were amazed that he had power over nature
In my eyes this probably had eliminated any doubts of his power since this is a miracle that is hard to fake so this had to be truly divine
