### Matthew 7:15-21 and Luke 6:43-45

Jesus warns us about false prophets. They best way to know if they are real is to see the "fruits" they yield. Just as a good tree bears good fruit and every tree is known by the fruit it yield so is everyone else. We must look at their life are they speaking life into ppl, are they doers of the word, are they fruits of the Spirit?


M19 [EW](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/matthew-7/) *It is not merely the wicked, the bearer of poison berries, that will be cut down; but the neutral, the man who bears no fruit of positive virtue must also be cast into the fire*. We must bear good fruit (be useful) preach the word, and yield something. 

What does that look like?
Anything that comes from your life that bring you closer to God and even others


M21
One can not enter the kingdom of heaven without the will of the father (makes sense)

M22-23
We can do everything outwardly to show our following for Christ, but without a relationship you will be not see the kingdom, he seeks intimacy 

check yourself does the outwards actions match your internal ones

L45 A good man brings good from good stored within opposite for bad 

L45 For the mouth speaks what it is full of. 
a bucket can only spill what it is full of what are you full of and what are you pouring out if somone knocks you down, you fall, get hurt
