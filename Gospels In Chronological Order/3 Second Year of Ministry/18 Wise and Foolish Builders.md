\### Matthew 7:24-27 and Luke 6:46-49

M24-25 L46-48

Those who hear his word and are doers of the word are those who built house on the rock, in luke he says v48"dug deep and laid the foundation on rock"

Jesus also requires us to be doers of his word
Because of this the storms did not affect the house, b/c it was well built

M7:26-27 and L6:46-49
The foolish are those who build it no the sand and when the rain, wind, storms, flood the house "fell with a crash"
In luke he says the foolish has no foundation, the sands are always changing and nothing can be help in place 

relates to [Proverbs 10:25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Proverbs+10.25&t=NKJV)

The important thing is that Jesus is calling the foolish, those who were told what is right/wrong but still does the wrong thing. Those who are ignorant don't know they were not told so they are not help by the same standard 

When we have christ as our foundation nothing can break us down, or shake us, even when storms of life come our way. 

What does it mean to have christ as your foundation?
When everything is going wrong what are you doing/who are you going to to fix it.
Prayer, we see earlier Jesus had said in Matthew 7:7-12 and Luke 11:5-13 [[15 Ask Seek Knock]]

It is fitting that this is the last portion of the sermon on the mount. After hearing all these teaching that Jesus gave he then challenged them to wise builder to follow his word.
