### Matthew 7:1-5 and Luke 6:37:42 (Seperate/repeated teaching in Perea)


M1 becareful with the measure you use to judge cause you are held by that same standard 
L 37 shows it more as the golden rule M7:12 were you will be treated as you have treated others 
L 38 analogy of grain, Jesus says that the criticizer will be criticized but those who are compassionate will be shown compassion to the max to the point of overfilling

L 39 can blind lead the blind, the leaders were blind in their relationship to God 

M3-5, L41-42 speck in eye same thing as blind leading the blind yet they were leading others to lead an impossible lifestyle, mark 7:9-13 they put traditions on top of ppl and thus departing far from God. It was easy for them to point out the errors of everyone else but they were unaware of their own plank. We are same, its far easier to criticize than to be real with yourself and point out your own flaws, we all love ego tripping. 


v6 *do not give dogs what is scared and do not give pearls to pigs*, be wise in who you entrust the word to. There will be some who hate hearing and those who are receptive. Jesus tells us to be discerning. 

interesting that this verse was mentioned in the same section of do not judge. We see previously that Jesus said *"V1 Do not judge, or you too woll be judged*", to be able to discern you need to judge
