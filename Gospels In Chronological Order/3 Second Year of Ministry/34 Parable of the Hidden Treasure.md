### Mt 13:44

#TheKingdomOfHeaven 
#parable


Kingdom of heaven like treasure in field. 

Field is the world 
Man is not us cause this treasure is us
We have nothing we can buy on our own but Jesus paid the price to own it, he did it **JOYFULLY** 

EW 
	i. “Under rabbinic law if a workman came on a treasure in a field and lifted it out, it would belong to his master, the field’s owner; but here the man is careful not to lift the treasure out till he has bought the field.” (Carson)

Jesus bought us with his redeeming blood for us the treasures
