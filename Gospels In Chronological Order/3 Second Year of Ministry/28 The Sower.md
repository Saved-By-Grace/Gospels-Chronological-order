### Mt 13:1-23; Mk 4:1-20; L 8:4-14

Jesus says a farmer was sowing his seed (singular). 
The seed (The message) was consistent among all four soils there was no difference to them, it was only the soil that changed.

"let those who have ears to hear, let them hear" 
- this is for all and all who hear it to pay recognize the words he spoke
- (EW says this isnt meaning for all to hear, more for a call to take special note)


Jesus preached this to the crowd, but after in private the disciples asked what this meant.

Jesus says how he speaks in parables to the ppl, quote [Isaiah 6:9,10](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.6.9-10.ESV) The people who won't be receptive to the message will not understand and thus still be condemned. Is this pointing to Jesus wanting a better way than the status quo (sacrifice)? Is he saying he wants to keep them ignorant so that it can lead to them eventually crucify him?

Sower can be seen as foolish for planting seeds in poor soils, but he can be viewed as a loving and fair sower since he freely gives them to all with out bias. 
#### The Path 
- birds ate
- they are ppl with harden hearts 
- path, they are stopping to see a spectacle (jesus) and keep passing along
- Devil comes quick, once people really hear the good news and understand whats He's done thats something satan cant take away
#### The Rocky Soil 
- sprouted quickly but because it was on shallow ground withered as the sun came
- They have short roots not firmly planted 
- When trials tribulations come you leave, wanting the path of least resistance 
- 
#### The Thorns
- Thorns which chocked and didn't bare grain
- "The worries of life", none godly desires overtake them making the word unfruitful 
- Just like rich man that came to Jesus but was unable to sell all he had Matthew 19:16-22; Mark 10:17-22;  Luke 18:18-23
#### The Good Soil 
- yielded a harvest where each seed yielding different amount some more than others but nonetheless created a large harvest, creating more seeds/fruits than the starting of the 1
- Why did some produce more than other good soil?
	- how much they relied on God. How much they were willing to sacrifice everything to Him and lean on him, creating desperate dependence. 



My applicatio:
What kind of soil are you, the soil can be transformed. 
We can go from rocky soil to good soil by trusting in God that he may remove the rocks or have the strength to over come rocks (think how trees are able to grow and break through stone and metal as the grow) that we have in our lives to be firmly planted with in Him. 

Thorns can go from good when we can remove the things in our lives that hold us back (Whjich are? school, career, people). We need to have our eyes focused more on Him. Or even be like Paul have a thorn in the flesh but makes us rely on God even closer.
