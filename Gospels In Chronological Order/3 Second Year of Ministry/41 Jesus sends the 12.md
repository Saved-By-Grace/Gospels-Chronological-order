Mt 9:35-38, 10:1-42
Mk 6:7-11
luke 9:1-6
#### Workers are few
mt 9:35-38 Mk 6:6
mt Jesus was in the synagogues preaching the #TheKingdomOfHeaven 
and healing people 
He saw the crowds around him and had compassion, Jesus compares the people like sheep without a shephard. 
He came to be their shepherd 

v37-38
harvest is plentiful but the workers are few
The world is ripe for souls that are ready to hear about god, they just need the workers to hear the good news and lead them the right way. 

*here we see Jesus set the disciples up with the mindset of reaching the lost*

#### Jesus calls the 12
mt 10:1-15, mk6:7-11, Lk 9:1-5
He gave them authority to drive out impure spirits, and heal. They couldn't do this on their own, no amount of studying Jesus could permit them from being able to do what he did. They needed to get authority from him
the 12 were 
- Andrew
- James Zebedee
- John
- Philip
- Bartholomew
- Thomas
- Matthew
- James
- Thaddeus
- Simon the zealot 
- Judas
mt10:6 interesting jesus told them not to go to gentiles, or samaria. He told them to go to to the "lost sheep of Israel". He came fro the jews first (the other books dont mention this verse)

In all 3 books he says to
- #preach #TheKingdomOfHeaven (mt, lk)
- heal the sick (mt, mk, lk)
- raise the dead (mt)
- cleanse those who have leprosy (mt, lk)
- drive out demons (mt, mk, lk)
-

He told them not to take money, no bags to store stuff, no extra shirt, sandals or staff because they had to rely on God to provide and fully trust in him. 

If you are not welcomed then shake the dust off you feet
- guess, usually when inviting someone in you give them a place to wash their feet. Them having dirty feet shows how un welcoming they are (wrong)
- bible commentary says " shaking dust from the feet was a sign of seperation, pious jews when leaving a gentile city would shke the dust off thier feet to seperate them from gentile practices, the displces did this to seperate themselves from jews who rejected christ"
those who rejected you, it would be more bearable for sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgement than for that town



#### Jesus Prepares The Disciples for Persection
Mt 10:16-33

He gives them instruction on what to expect 

v16 Jesus says 
"i am sending you out like sheeps among wolves"
- he calls them to be inoocent sheep that rely on the father amongst the wolves (jew leaders)
"be shrewed as snakes and innocent as doves"
- shrewd- 'sharp power of judegment'
- He calls them to be smart but innocent
- 
you will also be beaten in the synagogues
