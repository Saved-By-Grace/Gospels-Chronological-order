### Mt 13:31-32
#TheKingdomOfHeaven 
#parable




The kingdom is like a mustard seed, not mentioning faith like we see in mt 17:20. 
The kingdom of God is just like the mustard seed, where it goes from a humble seed which is the tiniest of all and grows larger than the other seeds. 

The KOG is the same way it starts off small Jesus, 12 disciples but grows enormously and is the dominant  religion of the world. We still have our part to share the word with others and get more people to know God and hear his word.
