v1
Jesus was preaching
and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God with his disciples with him


v2 there were also women that Jesus had ministered to 
- Mary Magdalene
- Joanna
- Susanna 

v3
They were helping support the ministry out of their own means, Jesus was living by faith and trust in God to provide for him


EW Luke mention women because this was uncommon for a religious leader to do
"It is an amazing thing to find Mary Magdalene, with the dark past, and Joanna, the lady of the court, in the one company." Barclay
