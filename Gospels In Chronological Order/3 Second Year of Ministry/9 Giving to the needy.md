### Matthew 6:1-4

V1 do not show the the facade of righteousness with the intent to hav people worship you
V2 Do not make a showing of your good deeds
what are the reasons for your good deed?
- Get praise from man and God?
- Honor God?
- Help others?
The intention behind everything matters
Would you still give if no one would ever see
V2 "Their have received their reward in full"
	The reward f human praise is all they get because that is what they wanted
	
v3 " “Keep the thing so secret that even you yourself are hardly aware that you are doing anything at all praiseworthy. Let God be present, and you will have enough of an audience.” (Spurgeon)" 
This could only happen if its is a reflex, that its so natural that you don't even think about it and could even possible forget.

V4 The lord will reward what is done in secret
