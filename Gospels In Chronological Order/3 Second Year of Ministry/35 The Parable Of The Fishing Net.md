#parable 

This is similar to [[29 The weeds]] were it shows what the end of days would be like. When the fishermen cast the net they are unable to control the type of fish they get. They get what they can and separate it after. They sort the good and the bad fish. The bad fish are thrown away cause there is no use for the. They bring no purpose. 

Jesus breaks down the parable to the disciples again

This is what it will be like in the end of age where the angles are the fishermen and the fish are the people being judged those who are bad fish are left to go #WeepingAndGnashingofTeeth 

v52 They teachers who understand are showing the promises and hopes of the old and the new testament
