Mt is an abridged version of Luke so we will stick with luke for this 

##### Observations
- They were walking
- 3 people having excuses to not follow Jesus right away, Jesus breaks down there excuse
- 2 said I will follow another was commanded by God
- Kingdom of God mentioned (ties well with #TheKingdomOfHeaven)


##### Questions
- The first man said he will follow but Jesus didn't give a yes or no, just a statement, what is the purpose of this statement?
	- Jesus statement seems to imply that where Jesus goes there is no home its always on the move
	- was Jesus kinda testing him saying following Him is not comfortable?
- Second man why doesn't Jesus want the man to bury his father?
	- Jesus seemed to always want people to care for their family as a way to honor God, this seems contrary
	- Possibly this man's father wasn't dead yet and was postponing following Jesus 
	- This man was the one who Jesus commanded to follow Him, unlike the others
- Let dead bury their own dead, u go preach KOG?
	- dead spiritually?
	- but him going back to his father could preach about KOGv
- Third like the first said he will follow Jesus, whats wrong with the man wanting to let his family know?
	- possibly family might talk him out of it
- No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks back is fit for the service of kingdom of God?
	- Understandable as a worker you need to look ahead to be able to plow properly
	- In the context the man is saying let me tell my family yet Jesus is saying the man he isn't looking for the kingdom of God since he seems to care more about his family
	- is this care about his family to get their approval, what is it that Jesus is truly getting at?


The first man seemed to care about his comfort
The second man wanted to delay his call, he wanted to follow Jesus when it was convenient 
The third man wanted to approval from his family or even first care for his family and then when his work was over follow Jesus 
- (SALT conference) She had said that culturally going away was a big party and long send off
- Jesus wanted the man to desire the the thought of God over his family
	- ei Nicodemus and his reputation
	- ei rich ruler that didn't want to give away his earthly riches to follow God
- He wants us to overcome the thing that holds us back from following Him
