### Mk 4:21-25 Lk 8:16-18

We are this light, this beacon of hope, what draws people into the darkness

v22 We the light are meant to be be seen visible or is it the light of the kingdom of God?
does this mean that we being imitators of God will be made visible even without trying? 

v24 Judging is okay as long as u are not a hypocrite (Pharisees), if you are then you are held by ur standards and even higher

v25 What is this more? we are talking about light as we become more mature in our walk we grow brighter and know more meaning that we are more responsible for the voice of the Holy Spirit. Those who start to dim or go away less is is given to them. You are not an effective tool for God and  his kingdom and secondly since you are not doing what you are told to do and know to be true you will be given less so that it will not be held against you.
