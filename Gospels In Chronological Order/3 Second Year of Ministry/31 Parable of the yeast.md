Yeast has been used as an negative connotation. We see 
- Jesus telling the disciples to beware of the yeast of the pharisees MT 16:6
- Paul talking to Galatian church 5:9
- Paul with corinthian church 1 Cor 5:8 
- others too but idk off top my head

yeast tho a small ingredient my mass/volume it enlarges the dough my so much

in the similar vein of mustard seed where something so small can become so big
