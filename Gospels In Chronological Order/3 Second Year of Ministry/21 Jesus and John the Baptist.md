### Matthew 11:2-16 and Luke 7:18-28

##### M2 L19-20 
John had been in prison and had sent his disciples to ask "are you the one who is to come...?" 

this is interesting because John Bap here is showing some uncertainty, where in John 1:29-32 he was sure, why this sudden doubt?

John B probably was not fully aware of Jesus' plan, he was imprisoned, but God had called him to preach. Why then does he need to be locked up while the messiah is here?

He probably had some doubts. 

##### M4-6 L21-23
Jesus lifted his doubts by not putting him down but simply showing the miraculous works of Jesus, "Blind receive sight, lame walk, leprosy cleansed, deaf hear, dead raised to life....". 
This all was fulfilling what Isaiah had said about him:
**EW** 
- **Blind** ([Isaiah 61:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+61.1&t=NKJV),Â [35:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+35.5&t=NKJV)).
- **Lame** ([Isaiah 35:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+35.6&t=NKJV)).
- **Deaf**  [Isaiah 35:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+35.5&t=NKJV)).
- **Dead Raised to life** ([Isaiah 26:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+26.19&t=NKJV)).
- **Poor hear the good news**([Isaiah 61:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Isaiah+61.1&t=NKJV)).
All these would prove to John, Jesus is he

##### M6 L23 
###### "Blessed is the man who does not stumble on account of me" 
Jesus knew that his coming was far from what the Jews expected. They wanted a great powerful man to liberate them and challenge the the political system.

However Jesus did not do that and in fact pointed out the wrongs of the Jews and their system. For some they would feel like they were unheard for their pleas. 

This shows that the plans we seem are right and the best course of action are not what is best and what God has planned. Jews wanted freedom but they were not aware what they were in chains of. We need to be aware of the same blindness we have.
