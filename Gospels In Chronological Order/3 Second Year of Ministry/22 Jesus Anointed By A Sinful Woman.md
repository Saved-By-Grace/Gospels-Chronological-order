### Luke 7:36-50

v36 Jesus was welcomed to the home of a pharisee
- Maybe some understood he was legit
- Maybe wanted to know more about Jesus 

v37-38 
Bold of her (possibly a prostitute) to come to the pharisee 
alabaster flask were expensive and was a gift for God

v38 weird positioning of how they were reclined 
- She weeped
- wet His feet with her tears
- wiped them with her hair
- kissed them
- poured perfume on them

She was thanking, and worshiping him, the tears were probably from a previous miracle he performed for her and she came back to thank the master

v39 Simon the Pharisee was a hater

v41-43Jesus explains to him ina parable to make it easy for him to understand
two ppl owed money, one had a large debt and the other a small debt. Both debts were forgiven, who would love the master more?

Simon understood the parable, though its not clear if he understood the implication


v44 
Jesus says that Simon the Pharisee did not: 
- give water for the feet
- did not give a kiss
- did not put oil on his head

however the women 
- washed his feet with her tears and hair
- kissed his feet
- poured perfume on his feet

[EW](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/luke-7/) says it perfectly, "Simon the Pharisee denied Jesus the common courtesies from a host to a guest â€“ washing the feet, a kiss for a greeting, and anointing the head with oil. Yet, he criticized the woman for giving these courtesies to Jesus."

Her sins were forgiven because of her faith and not her actions

naturlally everyone else was confused at Jesus claiming to have authority to forgive sins
