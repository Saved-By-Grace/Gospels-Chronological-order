v1 - Paul is attacking people that have the mindset of pharaisee that look at others doing wrong but are naive in their own sins, its easier to see the splint in your brothers eye than the plank in your own. 

v2-3 there is no escape dont think of your self from being exempt noe one is good


v4 mentions how god holds off his judgement as mercy to lead us to repentence giving time. my bible commentary, "we are more liekly to be amazed at Gods patience at others than our own"

v5 The more we hold off misinterperting his kindness and forbarence as approval of our actions the worse it gets durring judgemnet. 

v7 those who do good seek glory, honor, immortatily why word like this. We receive these things when we do good

however 
v8 those who are elfish only reeive wrath
9 -10 do good they get glory honor and peace, do no good get trouble
